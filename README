Schedulink is a student project coded in less than 36 hours and submitted to the HackMIT competition. 

This Chrome extension is built to compile meeting links in one central location and make joining them
simpler and easier. Schedulink requires the user to input their schedule and class meeting links before
using. The software then parses inputted data to recognize when meetings are about to start and sends 
notifications to the user containing information about their class and the meeting link itself. The
extension helps users cut down on the many pathways they currently have to take in order to join various
events.
